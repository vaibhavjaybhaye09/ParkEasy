# Welcome Email Functionality

## Overview

The ParkEasy application now includes a comprehensive welcome email system that automatically sends a confirmation email to users when their registration is completed successfully.

## How It Works

### 1. Registration Flow
1. User fills out the registration form
2. User account is created (initially inactive)
3. OTP verification email is sent
4. User verifies their email with OTP
5. **Welcome email is automatically sent** ‚úÖ
6. User account is activated
7. User can now login

### 2. Welcome Email Trigger
The welcome email is sent in the `verify_otp` view in `accounts/views.py`:

```python
if user.otp == otp and not user.is_otp_expired():
    # Verify user
    user.email_verified = True
    user.is_active = True
    user.otp = None
    user.otp_created_at = None
    user.save()
    
    # Send welcome email
    send_welcome_email(user.email, user.username)
    
    messages.success(request, 'Email verified successfully! You can now log in.')
    return redirect('login')
```

### 3. Email Content

The welcome email includes:

- ‚úÖ **Registration Success Confirmation**
- ‚úÖ **Welcome message with username**
- ‚úÖ **Login instructions**
- ‚úÖ **Direct login button**
- ‚úÖ **Feature overview**
- ‚úÖ **Professional styling**

## Email Template

**File**: `accounts/templates/accounts/email/welcome_email.html`

**Key Features**:
- Responsive HTML design
- Professional styling with CSS
- Clear success message
- Direct login link
- Feature highlights
- Branded with ParkEasy logo

## Email Function

**File**: `accounts/utils.py`

```python
def send_welcome_email(user_email, username):
    """
    Send welcome email after successful verification
    """
    subject = 'Welcome to ParkEasy - Registration Successful!'
    
    html_message = render_to_string('accounts/email/welcome_email.html', {
        'username': username,
        'site_name': 'ParkEasy',
        'site_url': 'http://localhost:8000'
    })
    
    # Send email with both HTML and plain text versions
    send_mail(
        subject=subject,
        message=plain_message,
        html_message=html_message,
        from_email=settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,
        recipient_list=[user_email],
        fail_silently=False,
    )
```

## Email Configuration

The email system uses the following settings from `settings.py`:

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'easypark655@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'zjxy bjmp utoy ncer'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
```

## Testing the Functionality

### 1. Manual Testing
1. Register a new user account
2. Check your email for OTP
3. Verify the OTP
4. **Check for welcome email** ‚úÖ

### 2. Automated Testing
Run the test script:
```bash
python test_welcome_email.py
```
