## How It Works

### 1. **Booking Flow**
1. Customer books a parking slot
2. Payment is processed
3. **Receipt is automatically generated** ✅
4. Customer is redirected to success page with receipt info
5. Receipt is stored in database for future access

### 2. **Receipt Creation Process**
```python
# In payment/views.py - checkout function
receipt = Receipt.objects.create(
    booking=booking,
    customer_name=f"{booking.customer.first_name} {booking.customer.last_name}".strip() or booking.customer.username,
    parking_place_name=booking.slot.place.name,
    slot_code=booking.slot.code,
    vehicle_type=booking.get_vehicle_type_display(),
    vehicle_number_plate=booking.vehicle_number_plate,
    start_time=booking.start_time,
    end_time=booking.end_time,
    duration_hours=booking.duration_hours,
    amount_per_hour=booking.slot.price_per_hour or booking.slot.place.price_per_hour,
    total_amount=amount,
    payment_status='success'
)
```

## Database Schema

### Receipt Model (`customer/models.py`)
```python
class Receipt(models.Model):
    booking = models.OneToOneField(Booking, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='receipt')
    receipt_number = models.CharField(max_length=20, unique=True, db_index=True)
    customer_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    parking_place_name = models.CharField(max_length=120)
    slot_code = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    vehicle_type = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    vehicle_number_plate = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    start_time = models.DateTimeField()
    end_time = models.DateTimeField()
    duration_hours = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)
    amount_per_hour = models.DecimalField(max_digits=8, decimal_places=2)
    total_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    payment_status = models.CharField(max_length=20, default='success')
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, db_index=True)
```

        ).order_by('-receipt_number').first()
        
        if last_receipt:
            last_number = int(last_receipt.receipt_number.split('-')[-1])
            new_number = last_number + 1
        else:
            new_number = 1
